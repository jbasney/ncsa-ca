NAME

        cacl - Certificate Authority CLient, request a digital 
               certificate and create a Globus user environment

SYNOPSIS
   
        cacl 

DESCRIPTION

        The cacl program is a user utility for requesting a digital
        certificate.  The program creates a certificate request which is
        sent to a CA (Certificate Authority) for signing.  The user is
        authenticated by the CA which checks the account name and password 
        in the request file against the account name and password in a 
        password file.  When a signed certificate is returned by the CA
        it is put into a .globus directory within the user's home 
        directory.  The matching private key for the certificate, a 
        PKCS#12 version of the certificate, and a symbolic link to a Grid 
        Security Infrastructure directory is also put into the .globus 
        directory.

        When you run the cacl program you will be prompted for your
        login password.  The password together with account information 
        extracted from the /etc/passwd file will be put into the 
        certificate request.  Next you will be prompted twice for a 
        private key encryption password.  This will be used to encrypt 
        your private key which will be stored in your .globus directory.
        After the CA has processed your request and returned your signed 
        certificate cacl will convert that certificate from PEM format 
        into PKCS#12 format so that the certificate can be imported into 
        a Netscape browser.  The private key is contained within the 
        PKCS#12 certificate file, the key is encrypted with the same 
        password used for the key file.

        When you have successfully run cacl you will find a .globus 
        directory in your home directory.  That directory will contain
        the following files:

        usercert.p12 - Your digital certificate and private key in
                       a PKCS#12 format certificate

        usercert.pem - Your digital certificate, signed by the CA 
                       daemon

        userkey.pem  - Your private key matching the public key
                       contained in your usercert.pem


ERRORS
  
       Before issuing a new certificate the CA will check see if a
       valid ceritficate already exists for the user, if such a 
       certificate exists a new certificate will not be issued.
       
       When the cacl program is run it checks to see if a .globus
       directory exists in the user's home directory.  If a .globus
       directory exists it is moved to .globus.old.  If both a
       .globus and a .globus.old exist cacl will quit.  Cacl can
       be rerun after the .globus directory has been renamed or
       removed.
