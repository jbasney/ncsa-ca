Changes requested by TAGPMA:

- We need to have a dedicated hardware firewall in front of the CA machines.

- We need to document the lifecycle of database entries and Kerberos
  principals to clearly demonstrate that principal names and DNs are
  never recycled.

- We need to consider the security of system backups.  Using Tivoli is
  probably OK, but we need to document how the backups are protected
  from tampering.

- We should *not* run AFS on the servers.

- The only open ports to the servers should be MyProxy, CACL, SSH, and
  NTP.  The dedicated hardware firewall should restrict SSH traffic to
  a specific gateway host.  It should also restrict NTP traffic, and
  we should consider secure NTP setup.

- All CA documentation should tell users to set 12 character
  passphrases (or longer) on their private keys.

- how are Kerberos accounts re-activated?
  need to document this

- secure backups?
  never restore from insecure backup

- need an addl firewall?
  put hardware firewall in front of server
  only allow MyProxy, SLCS, SSH, and NTP in

- need to check certificates against profile

- 2nd factor of authentication? date of birth?  This is a must in 
  http://www.eugridpma.org/temporary/IGTF-AP-classic-20050930-4-1-b2.pdf

Other issues:

- We need to use service certificates for community accounts.

- renewal? include in re-key section of slcs document?
